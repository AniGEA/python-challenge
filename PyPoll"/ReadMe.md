**PyPoll

PyPoll is a Python script designed to analyze poll data from a CSV file named election_data.csv. It calculates various election metrics such as the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won, and declares the winner of the election based on the popular vote.}

For the assignment I used resources from professor's demos and Xpert learning assistant. 

**Instractions:
