*Module 3 Challenge

**PyBank

PyBank is a Python script designed to analyze financial records of a company provided in a CSV file named budget_data.csv. It calculates various financial metrics such as the total number of months, net total amount of profits/losses, average change in profits/losses, and identifies the greatest increase and decrease in profits along with their respective dates.


For the assignment I used resources from professor's demos and Xpert learning assistant. 



**PyBank Instructions:

In this Challenge,the task is to create a Python script to analyze the financial records of the company. 

There ia a given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


**Results:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
